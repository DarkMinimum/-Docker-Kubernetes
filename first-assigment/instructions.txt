Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly! +

cd dir
docker build .

2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable. +

docker run -it python-hash
docker run -p 3000:3000 node-hash

3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.

docker run --name app-node-js -p 3000:3000 e299
docker restart app-node-js
docker stop app-node-js

docker run --name app-python -it 447d1
docker attach app-python
docker stop app-python

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.

docker ps -all
docker rm app-node-js
docker rm app-python
//docker prune

docker rmi 447d1703e18d
docker rmi e299281a24c8

5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.

docker build -t "python-module:latest" .
docker build -t "node-module:latest" .

6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.

docker run --name app-node-js --rm -p 3000:3000 node-module
docker run --name app-python --rm -it python-module
